        <p>We have had some great years together.<p>
        <p>Founded in 2006, we addressed a need in the video game industry for outstanding white-label co-development. We were involved in some fantastic feats and are proud of our accomplishments.</p>
        <p>In 2020, dotBunny went to sleep on the commercial front as it ceased seeking new co-development opportunities. The company continues to exist to protect the open-source projects under its wing, but it is a sleeping giant at this point.</p>
        <p>Our team has moved on to their next great adventures, and while we thank you for your interest, we will not respond to any inquiries.</p>
